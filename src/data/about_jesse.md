# Intro

I am a software and data engineer with a background in classical music. I am also experienced in the VC fundraising process from a data perspective; I help startups visualize their financial trajectories and present them in the most attractive light to VCs. I nuderstand what VCs look for when it comes to data and how important it is to use data to make a good first impression.

# Currently

At inate, I have learned how to collaborate with my team members, engage with clients and meet deadlines. I primarily work as a data engineer within a Flask and Microservices framework but have broad expereince across inate's stack from front to back. 

# Some history

- I grew up in Shanghai and moved to Vancouver when I was 12
  
- I didn't speak English but learned quickly through playing in youth orchestras and meeting friends there 
  
- I went to Italy by myself for the first time when I was 15 to play at a music festival; my wife and I try to go back there every year ever since we've known each other 

- I spent 4 years in Georgia and Indiana and grew to love that part of US 

- I am going to be a dad soon! My wife's family speeks Slovak and mine Chinese; there are going to be a lot of languages for all of us to learn
